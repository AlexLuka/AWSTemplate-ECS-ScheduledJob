# Configuration for your container and task.
# Note that the AWS_ACCOUNT_NUMBER must be an environment variable in your local environment.
# It is not an environment variable in the remote AWS environment. Why is it here? I just wanted
# to find a way to not push account number to a public git repo. This works without any issues.
# This can be executed with
#     dotenv -- copilot deploy
# if you have 'dotenv' utility installed on the local machine. The AWS_ACCOUNT_NUMBER variable is defined
# in the local .env file.
